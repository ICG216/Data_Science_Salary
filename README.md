# Data Science Salary Analysis

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on understanding trends in data science salaries across different countries, job titles, experience levels, and company sizes. Using Python libraries such as `pandas` and `numpy`, the dataset was explored to extract meaningful insights, visualize data trends, and answer key questions about salary distribution in the field of data science.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis includes the following key columns:
- **Job Title**: The title of the job (e.g., Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer).
- **Experience Level**: The level of experience (e.g., EN: Entry, MI: Mid-level, SE: Senior, EX: Executive).
- **Salary in USD**: The salary for the role, standardized to USD.
- **Company Location**: The country where the company is based.
- **Company Size**: Size of the company (e.g., S: Small, M: Medium, L: Large).

## Key Questions Addressed

We investigated which country offers the highest average salary for each specific job title, providing insights into location-based compensation differences.

### 3. Top 3 job titles with the highest salaries
This section highlights the top 3 job titles that command the highest average salaries across all countries.

### 4. What is the average salary for each level of experience?
We calculated the average salary for each experience level (Entry, Mid-level, Senior, and Executive) to understand how experience impacts earnings.

### 5. By what percentage does the salary increase between experience levels?
We analyzed the percentage salary increase as employees advance through different experience levels, from entry-level to executive positions.

### 6. Which experience level is more sought after?
This question explores the demand for different experience levels, showing which level has the most job positions available in the dataset.

### 7. What company size harbors the most employees?
We determined whether small, medium, or large companies employ the most people in the data science industry, based on the dataset.

### 8. Which countries have more large companies?
This analysis identifies the countries that host the most large companies, helping to understand the distribution of big organizations globally.

### 9. Which company size offers higher salaries?
We explored which company size—small, medium, or large—tends to offer higher average salaries to employees.
